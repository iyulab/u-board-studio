# Drawing boards with an AI assistant (MCP)

U-Board runs no model. It is the engine an assistant draws with: an assistant that speaks the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) reads and changes a workspace's boards and
data sources through [`@iyulab/u-board-mcp`](../packages/mcp/README.md) on npm, a small MCP server that talks to a
U-Board server with a workspace API token.

## Set it up

1. In the console, open the workspace settings and, under **API 토큰**, make a token — `write` to let the
   assistant draw, `read` to let it only look. Copy it: it is shown once.
2. Give the assistant the MCP server with two settings: `UBOARD_URL`, where your U-Board server is, and
   `UBOARD_TOKEN`, the token — for example, with Claude Code:

   ```sh
   claude mcp add u-board --env UBOARD_URL=https://board.example.com --env UBOARD_TOKEN=ubt_… -- npx -y @iyulab/u-board-mcp
   ```

   The package's README shows the configuration for other clients.

The token acts as you, in that one workspace. It never carries a data source's credential: a source that
needs a key, a token or OAuth is set up by a person in the console, and the assistant uses it by its id.

## Or on a board in a file, with no server

The same tools work on one board kept in a file, with no U-Board server and no token — to lay a board out with an
assistant first, or where there is nothing to run:

```sh
claude mcp add u-board -- npx -y @iyulab/u-board-mcp --board plant.board.json
```

The file is made, an empty board, when it is not there (`--kind canvas` or `grid`, the default); a file that is there must be
a board the server would store, or the server does not start and says why. Every change is checked as a server checks it —
a refused change leaves the file as it was — and written to the file at once, so you can open it beside the assistant and
watch it grow. Give either a file (`--board`) or a server (`UBOARD_URL` and `UBOARD_TOKEN`), not both.

With a file there are four tools: `describe`, `get_board`, `patch_board` and `validate`. The board is the file, so they need no board
named. There is no list of boards, no data source and no live data, so no `board_state`, `look`, `list_sources`,
`sample_source`, `describe_source` or `create_source`; a board's data reads are the business of whoever draws it with the
real source later.

## Or in the console: the chat panel

The board editor has an assistant of its own — **✦ AI 비서**, beside the board. Say what the board should show, and
it draws on the open board with the same tools, each change appearing as it is saved; it looks at what it drew and
fixes what runs past its box or fails to draw before it answers. It acts as the person signed in, on that board only
(it does not make or delete boards), and sending waits while the editor has unsaved edits.

The panel calls a model you choose: in **모델**, give the address of an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint
(`https://api.openai.com/v1`, a gateway, or a server running an open model), the model's name and its key. They are
kept in that browser only, and the requests go from the browser to that endpoint — the U-Board server neither holds
the key nor calls a model. So the endpoint must accept requests from the console's address (CORS). The panel's
`look` draws the board in the page itself, so it answers what it found without a picture. It writes to the model in the language of
your first message (Korean, Japanese and Chinese are named to it, and named again after each round of tool answers —
open models drift into the English those answers are written in).

## What the assistant can do

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `describe` | Explains the board language to the assistant: `rules` first — how the tools change a board, then the language itself, generated from its schema (where values come from and what they mean, the statuses, the parts and their kinds, the layout per view kind, elements and the look) — then a kind of part in full (`kind:gauge`, several by commas) and the JSON Schema by pointer. |
| `list_boards`, `get_board` | Reads boards — one part at a time, by JSON Pointer (`/parts/pump`). |
| `create_board`, `patch_board`, `delete_board` | Makes a board, changes it with JSON Patch (RFC 6902) on a revision — each answer carries the new revision and advice — and deletes one for good. |
| `rename_board` | Renames a board; its id — and so the links it is shared by and its history — stays. |
| `validate` | Checks a board, or a board with a patch, without saving — exactly as saving does. |
| `board_state` | What a saved board shows now — each part’s state, its connection quality and why, how old its data is — without values or a picture. |
| `look` | Draws a saved board as its viewers see it and answers a picture, with what went wrong while drawing — an element's error, a widget whose content runs past its box, values not live — and the advice saving gave that still stands, such as parts drawn over one another — first a one-line status: done, or how many problems and pieces of advice are left. It can show one part up close (with only that part's problems and advice), or the board on the other paper. |
| `describe_source` | What a data source says about itself, from the description document its owner named (OData `$metadata`, an OpenAPI document): its paths a page at a time, and for one path in full its fields with types, its key, what it relates to and the query options it accepts. |
| `list_sources`, `sample_source`, `create_source` | Lists the data sources (with the description of the paths each answers), answers what a source's response looks like (each value's JSON Pointer and type, and the fields that tell a list's items apart), and makes a source that needs no credential — an API (with, for one that answers an error with success, where it says so), or a static source that answers what is stored in it by path, marked as example data when it is. |

## How it stays reliable and light

- **One format, checked the same way everywhere.** What the assistant writes is the board document the
  console edits — validated by the same rules ([`api-reference.md`](https://github.com/iyulab/U-Board/blob/main/docs/api-reference.md), the published JSON
  Schema), with every problem named by its path and, where there is something to say, what to do instead.
- **Small changes, not whole documents.** The assistant reads the part it needs by pointer and sends a
  patch; the server applies it to the board as saved and saves it only on that revision, so two writers
  never overwrite each other unseen.
- **Draw once, place many times.** What no prepared widget draws is an element the board defines once —
  a template of HTML or SVG and CSS, isolated from the rest of the page, or a script in a sandboxed frame
  with no network ([`concepts.md`](https://github.com/iyulab/U-Board/blob/main/docs/concepts.md) — Element) — and places by name as often as needed.
- **The assistant sees what it drew.** `look` draws the board in a browser on the assistant's computer (installed
  Chrome or Edge, or the one `UBOARD_BROWSER` names) through the server's own share viewer, so the picture is what
  viewers see. The token goes on the server's API requests only — never into the page or its address — and the
  server needs nothing extra to run.
- **It tells the assistant what it sent.** Saving answers advice where parts would be drawn over one another, and
  an error names what came where something else was expected («expected an array — got an object …») — an
  assistant does not re-read its own output. A refused first document makes no board.
- **It works with open models, not only hosted ones.** The tools' inputs declare their shape and never use the
  empty schema for an open object, which some open-model tool-call parsers rewrite values under; the same board
  has been drawn through it by a 27B open model served with an OpenAI-compatible API.
- **Data comes through data reads only.** An element or widget never reaches a data source itself: a board's
  data read names a source and a request, its parts name the fields they show, and the server reads it, within
  the addresses the installation allows.
