# Changelog — @iyulab/u-board-mcp

All notable changes to this package are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the package follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — below 1.0, a minor release may contain breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`describe` rules name only the tools the assistant has.** On a board in a file (`--board`) the rules told of `list_boards`,
  `create_board`, the data sources' tools and `look`, which that mode does not offer, and an assistant followed them to a source
  that was not there. The rules now carry the workflow of the mode they are read in: a board in a file says there are no sources
  and no values, and to write the reads the board will need; a server's rules name `board_state` and `look` only when they are offered.
- **`validate` with neither a document nor a patch checks the board as it is saved.** It refused, naming what it wanted.
- **A board in a file is no longer advised that its reads name sources "of this workspace"** — it has no workspace, so every read
  was called wrong by `validate`.
- The rules' JSON Patch section says `add` makes only the last part of its path — a new board has no `/data` or `/statuses` to
  add into — and that renaming a part changes every `of` and `each` that names it.
- **`look` reports a text an element cuts short with "…"** — a built-in marker whose box is too narrow for its name showed
  "Ex…" while `look` answered "nothing to fix", because nothing spilled. It now says the element cuts a text short and that the
  node needs more width.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-10-27

### Added

- **`describe_source`**: what a data source says about itself, from the description document its owner named for it (an OData
  `$metadata`, an OpenAPI document) — its paths a page at a time, and for one path in full its fields with their types, its
  key, what it relates to and the query options it accepts.
- **A board in a file, with no server**: `u-board-mcp --board <file> [--kind grid|canvas]` works on one board kept in a file
  (made when it is not there). Its tools are `describe`, `get_board`, `patch_board` and `validate`, with no board named;
  every change is checked as a server checks it and written to the file at once. Giving a file and a server
  (`UBOARD_URL` / `UBOARD_TOKEN`) together is refused.
- **`BoardStore` and `WorkspaceStore`**: the board tools (`boardTools`, `createServer`) take a store of boards — a board to read
  and to change — instead of the HTTP client itself; the HTTP client is a `WorkspaceStore`, which also offers the tools about
  the list of boards and the data sources. The tools and their answers for a server are unchanged.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-10-27

### Changed

- **The board check and the rulebook come from `@iyulab/u-board-designer/check`**, and the board language and the viewer
  from `@iyulab/u-board` 0.36.0 (MIT). The tools and their answers are unchanged.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- `look` reports, as a problem of the part, how many items placed by their own fields were left out (no number in a field,
  or outside the frame); the rules (`describe({ topic: "rules" })`) teach the place by fields.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-10-25

### Changed

- **Breaking: the tools read and write boards in the board language** (data read once and given meaning once, parts by
  id, a layout per view kind). `describe("rules")` is how the tools change a board, then the language's rulebook,
  generated from its schema and kinds; `describe("kind:<name>")` gives a kind in full (its options with their types and
  defaults, several by commas); `describe("schema")` is the language's JSON Schema. `create_board` without a first
  board makes an empty one of its kind. `look` draws the picture the server makes of a board — the one the board is read with, so no
  second read — takes `focus: "/parts/<id>"`, and says what it found of the board's parts.
- Requires `@iyulab/u-board` with the board language in `./domain` and the picture model in `./picture`.

### Removed

- `UBoardClient.getPicture` (`./tools`): `getBoard` answers a board with its picture (`SavedBoard.picture`), read from
  the workspace's board route rather than the share route.
- `edit_board`: a board's parts are addressed by id, so a rename or a removal is a patch at the part and at where the
  layout places it. The topics `canvas`, `data`, `elements`, `components`, `mixed`, `widgets` and `widget:<type>` —
  the rulebook and `kind:<name>` say what they said, in the board language.
- `inDocument` (`./tools`), and a `look` focus on `/instances/<i>`: the picture a board is drawn as has no component
  instances, so a problem `look` finds is already reported at the part it is about.

### Added

- `create_source` makes a static source when no source has the values yet: `answers` as `[{ path, answer }]` (a list,
  so no tool argument is an open object) and `sample: true` for example values — the board reads it by path as any
  source and says «Example data» under it. `list_sources` gives a static source's type, the paths it answers and
  whether its answers are example data, not the answers themselves. Requires a server with static sources.
- `sample_source` names a list's items: for each list of objects, the values of the field that tells them apart
  (`names: { "id": ["input", "process-01", …] }`, up to 12) — an item is read by what it is called, not guessed from the
  first one. `validate`, as saving does, advises on a data read whose `from` is not a source's id — and gives the id when
  it names a source by its name.
- `sample_source` takes `timeZone` and `requestTime`, so a request with time places is read for the time the binding
  will ask for.
- `findProblems` (from `./tools`) takes `{ spillTolerancePx }`: how far an element may draw past its box before it is
  reported (1 px, as before, when left out) — for a page that draws a few px of decoration over an edge on purpose.

### Changed

- `describe("elements")` says that nothing an element draws reaches past its box, so a shadow needs room inside it.
- `describe("data")` says how to bind a source asked for the data of a given time: time places in `path`
  (`{{now:yyyyMMdd}}`) with `timeZone` and `requestTime`.
- Requires `@iyulab/u-widgets` 0.42 (a state is a `tone`; a format is a string; a toned item may give its own mark).

### Fixed

- `look` measures a widget in a canvas drawn larger or smaller than its size (a canvas scaled to its grid cell) in the
  widget's own px: it reported a widget that fits as running past its box by the scale, and missed one that did not fit
  in a canvas drawn smaller.
- `look` with `focus` on a part drawn outside the screen, or with no size, says so instead of failing to take the
  picture.
- `look` no longer reports an element drawing past its box for what the element itself cuts off: a part's box is cut by
  every box inside the element whose `overflow` clips it (from a positioned part's containing block up), so a
  decoration clipped at the element's edge is not taken for one drawn over its neighbours.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-10-21

### Changed

- Requires `@iyulab/u-board` 0.33.1 and `@iyulab/u-widgets` 0.39.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-10-21

### Changed

- Requires `@iyulab/u-board` 0.33, which sizes a connector's label (`labelSize`) and lets a grid item drawn by an
  element stretch to its row.
- The `elements` topic says a grid item without a height grows from the element's `size.height`.
- The `canvas` topic teaches a connector's `labelSize`, and to raise it on a board drawn large.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-10-21

### Changed

- Requires `@iyulab/u-board` 0.32, which draws a connector's `curved` route.
- `describe("view")` names a connector's `route: "curved"` (a bow to the left of the way it runs, as flows on a map).

## [0.19.0] - 2026-10-21

### Added

- `describe` reads several widgets in one call: `widget:metric,chart.bar,status` answers each in full by its type (up
  to 8), an unknown one answering why in its place. An assistant read the widgets of a step one call at a time — a
  round trip each to the model endpoint.

### Changed

- `describe("rules")` says a prepared widget's title is its `title` prop, drawn inside its box — a chart is titled there,
  not with a header item above it. Other lines of the topic are shortened to keep it within its size.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-10-21

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.31.0`.

### Added

- `@iyulab/u-board-mcp/tools`: the board tools without the MCP server, for a host that offers them to a model itself —
  `boardTools(client)` gives each tool's name, description, input and handler, and `functionTool(tool)` lists it as an
  OpenAI-compatible chat completions function, with the same input schema the MCP server lists. Nothing it imports
  needs Node. `UBoardClient` also takes a workspace instead of a token, for a page signed in to the console: its
  requests carry the session cookie.
- `look` from a looker that draws the board without taking a picture (`Looker.picture: false` — a host drawing it in its
  own page) answers the report alone, and its description says so. The checks it runs on the drawn page —
  `findProblems`, `countQualityMarks` (both now taking the box the board is drawn in), `placedParts`, `inDocument` — are
  exported from `@iyulab/u-board-mcp/tools`.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-10-20

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.30.0` (widgets from `@iyulab/u-widgets` 0.38 — `describe("widget:metric")` shows a
  sparkline, and the advice of the tools that write and check a board names a misspelt field of a reference line or a
  series).

### Fixed

- `look` no longer reports a widget's content running past its box when only a line's text reaches a few pixels below
  it — a font taller than a tight line height, as a metric's large value draws on its own in a grid cell with no
  height. What runs past downward is measured by the boxes drawn, shadow roots within the widget included.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-10-20

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.29.0`.

### Added

- A grid's cell can hold a canvas (a mixed board — a plan or map in one cell, cards around it). `describe` teaches it,
  `edit_board`'s `remove` takes a canvas cell's nodes, connectors and decorations, and `look` checks a cell's nodes and
  focuses them — `describe("mixed")` is its topic. A grid item can span rows (`rowSpan`).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-10-20

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` 0.28 and `@iyulab/u-widgets` 0.36 — a binding still being read from a slow source reads
  `pending`; `help('form')` and `validate` know a form's `fieldStates`, and a form's `formdown` is checked by formdown.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-10-20

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` 0.27 — it checks a board with the same rules the server saves by.

### Added

- `create_source` takes `sourceError` — where a source that answers an error with success says so — and
  `sample_source` says, for such an error, what the source said and who fixes it.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-10-20

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` 0.26 — it checks a board with the same rules the server saves by.
- `sample_source` takes a source's name as well as its id, when no other source has that name — people name their
  sources, and an assistant uses their words. The answer then gives the id, which a binding's adapter takes.
- The connector rules show a bound label keeping its unit: `"{{value | fixed:1}} Mbps"`.
- The element rules say an element's sizes include padding and border.
- The colour rules name the theme colours a board can use instead of a hex value: `positive`, `warning`, `negative`,
  `accent`.

### Fixed

- `look` takes its picture with animations stopped at their start, so a blinking state's ring is always drawn on —
  a picture taken mid-blink showed the ring as missing, and an assistant rebuilt it inside its element instead.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-10-20

### Added

- `rename_board({ board, name })`: renames a board in place — its id, share links and history stay. Without it, an
  assistant asked to rename a board made a new one with the same document and deleted the old one. The rules point to it.
- `describe("elements")` names a template value's digits, `{{v | fixed:1}}`.

### Fixed

- The README's tool table lists `edit_board`.

### Changed

- Takes `@iyulab/u-board` 0.25: a template value's digits (`{{v | fixed:1}}`) and a description list validate as the
  server does.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- `list_sources` answers each source's description (the paths it answers, as its owner wrote them); `create_source`
  takes one. `sample_source` that finds nothing at a path points to it.
- `edit_board({ board, revision?, commands, dryRun? })`: the edits that change a board in more than one place, as the
  editor makes them (rename or remove an element, a symbol or a component; remove parts with the lines and triggers
  that name them; make a component; detach an instance), saved as one JSON Patch on the revision it read. A command that
  cannot run answers `INVALID_COMMAND` with its index and path, and nothing is saved. The rules point to it.

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.24.0` (`applyEditCommands`, `documentPatch`).
- `validate` of a board and a patch says nothing is saved yet and the revision to send the patch on (`next`).
- The data rules say a binding's key is the path inside the props — an element's own prop `"status"`, never
  `"props.status"`.
- `sample_source` that could not read a source says what to do next (`next`), by the reason: for a path the source
  has nothing at, ask the person for the source's paths rather than guess them; for a refused credential, the
  source's owner fixes it in the console; for an answer that is not JSON, the path is not one a binding can read.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-10-17

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.23.0`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- `describe("components")` teaches components — a group of canvas parts defined once and drawn per instance with its own
  parameter values: when to use one, `{{param}}`, the `<instance id>/<part id>` names, where an issue is reported.
- `look` checks the parts component instances draw, reporting a problem at the part's node in the component and naming
  the instance; `focus: "/instances/1"` shows one instance, with what is said of its component.

### Changed

- Needs `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.22.0` (components).
- `describe("components")` tells a component from an element: a card that is one picture filled with values is an
  element placed per card; a component is for a group whose parts are nodes of their own. A schema pointer with nothing
  there says to leave it out for the whole schema.

### Fixed

- Widget advice judges a component's widgets as each instance draws them, its parameters filled in, rather than the
  `{{name}}` they are written with.

### Security

- `@iyulab/u-widgets` `^0.35.3`: the widget advice and rules come from the release that escapes markdown link quotes and
  heatmap tooltip names.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- The rules teach a connector's `style.route: "orthogonal"` — pipes and wiring with right-angle turns.

### Fixed

- `look` no longer reports bold text on a gradient as reading at 1:1: the colour behind a text is the commonest one
  in its box other than its own ink — the glyph's pixels could outnumber each step of the gradient. Text drawn on its
  own colour is still reported.

### Changed

- `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.21.0` — a patch naming a member an object does not have says what the object has and where
  the member is; `@iyulab/u-widgets` `^0.35.2` — `describe("widget:chart.gantt")` says `color` groups its bars.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- `look` answers a one-line `status` first: `done — nothing to fix`, or how many problems and pieces of advice are left
  (for the part, when it looks up close). The count includes the layout advice folded past the list's limit, and up
  close every finding about the part is kept, even one the whole board's list would fold.

### Fixed

- `look` with `focus` answers only that part's problems, as it already did its advice — it gave the whole board's
  problems while its status counted them as the part's.

### Changed

- `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.20.0`.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-10-16

### Changed

- `@iyulab/u-board` `^0.19.0`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- `describe("rules")` teaches triggers: their shape, the five events and four actions, how an element raises an event
  (`data-ub-event`, `ub.emit`), that a link fills only `{{node}}`, `{{state}}`, `{{board}}`, and that showing another
  board is the host’s to do.

### Changed

- `@iyulab/u-widgets` `^0.35.0` — the widget examples and option lists `describe` answers come from it.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- The `board_state` tool — what a saved board shows now, part by part (state, connection quality and why, how old its
  data is), without values. The rules name it as the cheap check before `look`; `describe("data")` teaches `states`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- The `canvas` topic teaches a frame name's own colour, `labelFill`.

### Changed

- The `canvas` topic says a node without a box takes its element's size; `look` measures the board the same way.
- The `elements` topic says how a symbol's parts are styled: in the symbol, or by what they inherit from the `<use>` —
  an element's CSS selectors do not reach into what a `<use>` draws.

### Fixed

- `look` answers the advice that still stands with its picture — parts drawn over one another, as saving reported
  them. A picture with no drawing problems no longer reads as a board without faults; with `focus`, only that part's
  advice.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- `look` can `focus` a connector (`"/connectors/2"`) — its line, heads and label up close.
- The `canvas` topic teaches a connector's `arrow` (and binding it to a value's sign) and `labelAt`.
- The `canvas` topic teaches a frame's own name (`label`, `labelAt`), `radius` and `dash`, and a text's `anchor` and
  `background` — a frame no longer needs a separate text for its name, nor a tag a rect behind it.
- `delete_board` — deletes a board for good, marked destructive so a client can ask first. A data source is still
  removed by a person in the console.
- The `elements` topic teaches document `symbols` — drawings every template element places with `<use href="#name">`.
- The rules teach a board's `accent` — the colour to set instead of fixing one in a widget or an element.

### Changed

- `look`'s `quality` counts the parts — nodes, grid items and now connectors — by the quality they show (`stale`,
  `disconnected`) instead of by the words on a node's mark, so a connector whose bound label or style is not current is
  counted too.

### Fixed

- `look` no longer reports text kept for a screen reader alone (in a box of a pixel) as reading poorly against the
  picture.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-16

### Changed

- `create_board` makes no board when its first document is refused: the document is checked first, as the server
  would, and a board the server then refuses is taken away again — failed attempts used to leave empty boards.
- The tools' inputs declare their shape: a patch operation is `{ op, path, value?, from? }` and a document needs
  `kind`; an operation or a document nested in its own first key is refused with what to write instead.
- Open objects in the tools' inputs are written `additionalProperties: true`, never the empty schema `{}`: a widely
  used open-model tool-call parser rewrites the values under an empty schema (arrays came back as objects), so the
  model was refused for what it never sent. A test keeps `{}` out.
- `look` reports text that reads under 3:1 against what is actually drawn behind it (measured on the picture, so a
  panel painted under a widget counts) — on either paper. A focused part is taken with room around it (at least half
  its size), so what spills past its box shows.
- The `canvas` and `data` topics teach a connector's `bindings` (label and style from live values).
- The `canvas` topic teaches a node's `caption` — a device's name under its icon, with the box kept icon-sized.

- `@iyulab/u-board` ^0.14.0.
## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- **`look`** — draws a saved board as its viewers see it, in Chrome or Edge on this computer (or the browser
  `UBOARD_BROWSER` names), through the server's share viewer, and answers a picture with a report: how big it was
  drawn, an element's error or notice, a widget whose content runs past its box, how many values are not live, and
  the page's own errors. `focus` takes a JSON Pointer to one node, grid item or decoration; `appearance` draws it on
  the other paper. The token goes on the server's API requests only. Needs a server that lets a workspace API token
  read through its share routes (U-Board 0.4.0).

### Changed

- The rules tell an assistant that a script element's code must always return.
- `describe` answers in smaller topics: `rules` is the workflow, JSON Patch, the kinds and how a widget's props are
  written; `canvas` (new) gives coordinates, default sizes, connectors, decorations, colours and drawing order; `data`
  (new) holds sources and bindings. `widgets` lists one line per widget by category and takes a `query`;
  `widget:<type>` gives its examples as a board places them (`{ type, props }`).
- An unknown id (404) answers with where to find the ids.
- The `canvas` topic teaches a connector's `label` and `style`, and that links between the same nodes are drawn
  side by side.
- `validate`, `create_board` and `patch_board` advise on the prepared widgets they check or write, with the widget
  library's own check (`checkSpec`): a type it does not have (and a near spelling), a prop no widget reads, an option
  the widget does not have or of the wrong type. A prop a binding fills is not reported.
- `validate` checks as the server saves: a field the document format does not have, a decoration colour a canvas
  cannot read and a connector to a missing node are issues, each naming what that place takes.
- `@iyulab/u-board` ^0.13.0, `@iyulab/u-widgets` ^0.34.0 (its `checkSpec`), `playwright-core` ^1.64.1 (for `look`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-15

### Added

- The first release: an MCP server that lets an AI assistant read and draw the boards of a U-Board workspace
  through a workspace API token (`UBOARD_URL`, `UBOARD_TOKEN`), run with `npx -y @iyulab/u-board-mcp`.
- Tools: `describe` (the rules for writing a board, elements, the JSON Schema by pointer, the prepared widgets),
  `list_boards`, `get_board` (one part of a document by JSON Pointer), `create_board`, `patch_board` (JSON Patch on
  a revision, answering the new revision and advice), `validate` (without saving), `list_sources`, `sample_source`
  (what a data source's response looks like, not the response itself) and `create_source` (a source that needs no
  credential). Answers are compact, and a failure says what to do next.
