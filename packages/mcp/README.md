# @iyulab/u-board-mcp

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets an AI assistant read and draw the boards of a
U-Board workspace — its own words to the assistant are in the tools it offers, starting with
`describe({ topic: "rules" })`.

It talks to a U-Board server with a **workspace API token**: in the console, open the workspace settings,
and under **API 토큰** make a token (`write` to draw, `read` to look). The token acts as you, in that
workspace only, and never handles a data source's credentials — you enter those in the console.

## Run it

```sh
UBOARD_URL=https://board.example.com UBOARD_TOKEN=ubt_… npx -y @iyulab/u-board-mcp
```

With Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add u-board --env UBOARD_URL=https://board.example.com --env UBOARD_TOKEN=ubt_… -- npx -y @iyulab/u-board-mcp
```

In a client's JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "u-board": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@iyulab/u-board-mcp"],
      "env": { "UBOARD_URL": "https://board.example.com", "UBOARD_TOKEN": "ubt_…" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `describe` | What a board can hold and how to write one: `rules` (read first — how the tools change a board, then the board language), `kind:<name>` (a kind of part in full — its options with their types and defaults; several by commas, `kind:stat,chart.bar`, up to 8 in one read), `schema` (with a JSON Pointer for one part). |
| `list_boards` | The workspace's boards. |
| `get_board` | A board, or one part of it by JSON Pointer (`/parts/pump`), with its revision. |
| `create_board` | A new board of a kind (`grid` or `canvas`), empty or with a first board. |
| `patch_board` | Changes part of a board with a JSON Patch (RFC 6902) on a revision; answers the new revision and advice. |
| `rename_board` | Renames a board; its id, share links and history stay. |
| `delete_board` | Deletes a board for good (marked destructive, so a client can ask first). A data source is removed in the console. |
| `validate` | Checks a board, a board with a patch, or — with neither — the board as it is saved, without saving. |
| `look` | A picture of a saved board as its viewers see it, with what went wrong while drawing; `focus` one part (`/parts/<id>`), or `appearance` the other paper. Needs Chrome or Edge on this computer, or `UBOARD_BROWSER`. |
| `list_sources` | The workspace's data sources — never a credential; a static one with the paths it answers and whether its answers are example data. |
| `sample_source` | What a source's response looks like: each value's JSON Pointer, type and example, and the fields that tell a list's items apart. |
| `create_source` | A data source that needs no credential — an API, or one that answers what is stored in it by path (example values when no source has them yet); one that needs a credential is made by a person in the console. |

Reads take a JSON Pointer so only the part needed travels, and a change is a patch answered with the new
revision — the document is never sent back. Every answer is compact JSON.

### A board as files (optional)

Start with `--bundle` (or `UBOARD_BUNDLE=1`) and two more tools read and write the same board as files — for an assistant that edits an
element's markup, style and script more than it moves parts. The board is still one stored document; the files are a way to read and write it.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `get_bundle` | The board as files: `board.json` (parts, layout, states, skin — where an element's code or the background picture moved out it holds `{ "$file": path }`), `elements/<name>.html`, `.css`, `.js` (a name that is not word characters and dashes is percent-encoded) and `background.svg`. Without `files`: the list with sizes and `board.json`; with `files`: the text of those. |
| `put_bundle` | Saves the board from files: the ones you give replace the files of the same path, the rest stay, and the board is saved whole and checked as any change is. An issue names the file it is in. |
