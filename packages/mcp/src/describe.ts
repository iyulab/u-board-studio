## Workflow
1. list_boards → pick a board (rename_board renames it), or create_board({ name, kind, document? }).
2. get_board({ board, pointer }) — read only the part you need ("/parts/pump", "/layout"); note its revision.
3. Change it with patch_board({ board, revision, patch }) — a JSON Patch (RFC 6902). Start small (a few parts), then add and fix.
   Each save is a new revision; a new board is revision 1, create_board with a document saves revision 2.
4. Read the answer: the new revision and advice — act on it. A 412: someone saved since — get_board, patch again.
5. validate({ document } | { board, patch }) checks without saving, exactly as saving does.
6. board_state({ board }) — what each part shows now (state, quality), no picture: the cheap check after a change to states or data.
7. look({ board }) after a change — a picture as viewers see it, what went wrong while drawing, and the advice that still stands. Fix both — the board is done when both are empty (its status says so); focus a part to see it up close.

## JSON Patch
- Everything is addressed by id: "/parts/pump", "/data/pumps/fields/flow", "/layout/place/pump" (a canvas), "/layout/items/-" (a grid).
- \`add\` sets an object member, existing or not, and appends to an array with "/-". \`replace\` and \`remove\` need the member to exist —
  use \`add\` for a field that may be absent.
- A part is placed by the layout: add or remove it in "/parts" and where the layout places it, in one patch. Renaming a part is
  removing it and adding it under the new id, in both places.
- Escape "/" in a key as "~1" and "~" as "~0". A patch applies entirely or not at all; an error names the operation.

## Sources
- A data read's \`from\` is a source's id (list_sources gives them, with what each answers); its \`path\` is a request —
  sample_source({ source, path }) shows what it answers, value by value. A source that needs a key is made by a person in the console.
- A source with a \`descriptionDocument\` in list_sources publishes what it answers: describe_source({ source }) lists its paths a page at a time,
  describe_source({ source, entry }) gives one in full — its fields with their types, its key, what it relates to, the query options it accepts.
  Find the path and the fields there; sample_source then shows a real answer.
- No source has the values yet (a mock-up, a new screen): create_source({ name, answers: [{ path, answer }], sample: true }) makes one
  that answers what you store, by path — the board reads it with \`from\` + \`path\` as any source, and is moved to a live one by
  changing \`from\` alone. Say the board shows example data.`;
