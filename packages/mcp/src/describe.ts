- \`add\` sets an object member, existing or not, and appends to an array with "/-". \`replace\` and \`remove\` need the member to exist —
  use \`add\` for a field that may be absent. \`add\` makes only the last part of its path: a board has no "/data" or "/statuses" until you
  add them (an object \`{}\`), and what goes inside comes after, or add the whole object at once.
- A part is placed by the layout: add or remove it in "/parts" and where the layout places it, in one patch. Renaming a part is
  removing it and adding it under the new id, in both places — and in every "of" or "each" that names it.
- Escape "/" in a key as "~1" and "~" as "~0". A patch applies entirely or not at all; an error names the operation.`;

## Sources
- A data read's \`from\` is a source's id (list_sources gives them, with what each answers); its \`path\` is a request —
  sample_source({ source, path }) shows what it answers, value by value. A source that needs a key is made by a person in the console.
- A source with a \`descriptionDocument\` in list_sources publishes what it answers: describe_source({ source }) lists its paths a page at a time,
  describe_source({ source, entry }) gives one in full — its fields with their types, its key, what it relates to, the query options it accepts.
  Find the path and the fields there; sample_source then shows a real answer.
- No source has the values yet (a mock-up, a new screen): create_source({ name, answers: [{ path, answer }], sample: true }) makes one
  that answers what you store, by path — the board reads it with \`from\` + \`path\` as any source, and is moved to a live one by
  changing \`from\` alone. Say the board shows example data.`;

This is one board, kept in a file — no U-Board server, so no list of boards, no data sources and no values: the board is laid out and
checked here, not drawn. Tools that need a server are not offered.

## Workflow
1. get_board({ pointer }) — read only the part you need ("/parts/pump", "/layout"); note its revision. A new board is empty: no parts, an empty layout.
2. Change it with patch_board({ revision, patch }) — a JSON Patch (RFC 6902). Start small (a few parts), then add and fix.
   Each save is a new revision.
3. Read the answer: the new revision and advice — act on it. A 412: someone saved since — get_board, patch again.
4. validate({ document } | { patch }) checks without saving, exactly as saving does; validate({}) checks the board as it is saved.

${JSON_PATCH}

## Sources
- A data read's \`from\` names the source the board will read through once it is on a U-Board server, and its \`path\` is the request
  there. Nothing here knows that source, so nothing checks it and no value comes back: write the reads the board needs, with the fields
  you expect, and tell the person which source to connect and which paths to point it at.
- The person who wants to see the board with example values puts it on a U-Board server — a sample source makes the values there.
  Do not invent a source and do not write values into the board: values live in a source, never in the board.`;
